/*
Package migrations supplies the authorization policy tables' DDL, rendered for a dialect and table prefix.

The platform deliberately does not ship a numbered migration file. Migration
files are numbered globally per consumer, so a platform-owned number would
collide with the consumer's own the moment either side added one. The version is
therefore always the consumer's to choose.

If you already run database/migrate, hand SQL to WithGeneratedMigration and the
tables are created by your normal migration run — no DDL copied into your
repository, nothing to keep in sync as this package evolves:

	ddl, err := migrations.SQL(dialect.Postgres, database.DefaultTablePrefix)
	// ...
	m, err := migrate.New(dialect.Postgres, myMigrations,
		migrate.WithGeneratedMigration(44, "create_authorization_tables", ddl),
	)

Statements is the same DDL split into individually executable statements, for
callers running it some other way — a different migration tool, or a test that
just wants the tables.

The rendering and prefix vetting live in database/ddl, shared with every other
schema-shipping package in this module.
